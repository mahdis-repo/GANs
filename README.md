# GANs

This repo is a survey of different GAN architectures which are implemented in PyTorh or Tensorflow. 

* Vanilla GANs are tricky to get them to converge. Funnily, in the very first try my [simple dense GAN](https://github.com/mahdis-repo/GANs/blob/main/First_Dense_GAN_1_MNIST.ipynb) did'nt converge and the discriminator won! Since it got pretty good, the generator could'nt find a mapping for guassian noise to latent distribution of the MNIST dataset.
